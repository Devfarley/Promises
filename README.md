What is a Promise?
A promise is an object that will supply a value in the future. 
How do we use Promises?
To create a promise you must declare a "new" Promise. Most common use of promses is consuming them from other sources.
To use a promise you should give it two options one is if the promise is completed sucessfully and the other if the promise
is rejected or an error occers. 
What are the benefits of using Promises?
They allow you to run asynchonous fuctions. Basically a function that runs separately from the rest of your script.
